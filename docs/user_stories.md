# Application User Stories

This document outlines the key user roles and their intended capabilities within the persona management application.

---

### **1. Super Administrator: Brand Configuration**

- **As a:** Super Administrator (e.g., a "Magnus" user)
- **I want to:** Access a "Brand Setup" area where I can create, select, and edit different brand configurations.
- **So that I can:** Onboard new client brands by customizing the application's logo, colors, and fonts to match their visual identity before they start using the tool.

### **2. Super Administrator: Persona Management**

- **As a:** Super Administrator
- **I want to:** Be able to upload, view, and delete personas for _any_ of the configured brands.
- **So that I can:** Manage the core content of the application on behalf of any client brand.

### **3. Brand User: Persona Management**

- **As a:** Standard Brand User (e.g., a "Korn Ferry" user)
- **I want to:** Be able to upload, view, and delete personas _only_ for my own brand.
- **So that I can:** Manage the persona library for my organization.

### **4. Brand User: Restricted Access**

- **As a:** Standard Brand User
- **I want to:** Be prevented from seeing or accessing the "Brand Setup" page.
- **So that I can:** Use the application without being exposed to administrative features that are not relevant to my role and could break the application's configuration.
