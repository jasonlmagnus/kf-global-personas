This is particularly true when working on regulatory or risk projects or programs. Too often the focus of the consulting firms is to deliver best in class risk and regulatory outcomes but often it seems that the focus on the best commercial outcome is lacking I.e. Balancing incremental costs against regulatory and risk requirements with the goals of long-term profitability.  For example, I see recommendations for goldplating of all regulatory and risk processes agnostic of the true level of economic risk reduction achieved versus the cost required. A consulting firm which never loses focus on the fact that we are a commercial enterprise and advised us on where not to go plate and to take some risk would be refreshing.",Because we have an active dialogue and relationship with most consulting firms we tend to trust our own perspective and experience when evaluating partners.
