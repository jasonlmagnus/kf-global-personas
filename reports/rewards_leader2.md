Report for Rewards Leadership: Understanding Workforce Perceptions on Pay, Benefits, and Equity from the 2025 Global Workforce Survey
Introduction
As Rewards Leaders, our core mission is to design and implement total rewards strategies that not only attract and retain top talent in an increasingly competitive global market but also ensure internal equity, external competitiveness, and compliance across various jurisdictions. The 2025 Global Workforce Survey provides crucial data on employee perceptions and priorities regarding compensation, benefits, and fairness in rewards processes. By analyzing these insights, we can better understand the link between rewards, employee motivation, trust, and overall organizational effectiveness. This report synthesizes the most relevant survey findings to inform our strategic approach to compensation, benefits, and performance-related rewards, helping us champion fairness and drive organizational performance.
Key Findings Overview
The survey data underscores the paramount importance employees place on pay, not just as income, but as a significant indicator of their value to the organization. Alongside competitive compensation, employees prioritize benefits that meet their evolving needs and perceive fairness in pay and advancement opportunities differently across various demographic segments. While overall sentiment on some aspects of support is positive, specific areas related to pay equity perceptions and the balance between salary and broader benefits highlight critical areas for attention for Rewards Leaders.
Deep Dive into Relevant Insights

1.  Pay as the #1 Validator and Talent Magnet (Q1 & Q1-3 Stories) The survey data strongly indicates that pay and compensation remain the most important factors for employees considering a new job. The "Money as a Measure of Worth" story highlights that pay has become the ultimate litmus test, signaling how much an organization values its employees. This extends beyond just a decent salary; it's about perceived worth. For Rewards Leaders, this reinforces the need to stay ahead of market pay rates and ensure that our compensation structures are not only competitive but also communicate value effectively. The importance of competitive pay for attracting talent is particularly pronounced in certain segments, such as younger employees and those in specific regions like Brazil and India. To attract talent in these segments, top-tier pay packages combined with strong career advancement and learning/development opportunities are essential.
2.  Perceptions of Pay Equity and Bias (Q6) A critical finding for Rewards Leaders is the perceived disparities in pay equity across different demographic groups. The data reveals notable differences in how employees feel overlooked for pay rises.
    ◦
    By Gender: 37% of female respondents feel overlooked compared to 27% of male respondents. This perceived gender gap in pay equity is a significant concern.
    ◦
    By Race: Overall, 34.3% of respondents feel overlooked for pay rises due to racial factors. This perception varies significantly by region, for example, 56% in the UK versus 19% in Germany. Other regional variations in this perception include 42% in Australia and 40% in Brazil.
    ◦
    By Age: Younger employees (18–24) report the highest level of perceived bias in being overlooked for pay rises at 40%, compared to only 14% for older employees (55–65). These findings reflect subjective employee perceptions. However, they highlight the need for robust pay equity analyses and transparent remediation efforts. While ERGs are in place, the high percentage of respondents feeling overlooked suggests potential gaps in their impact on addressing systemic biases, including those related to compensation. Addressing perceived biases in leadership selection is also crucial, as leadership decisions often impact compensation and advancement opportunities. Rewards Leaders must collaborate with DEI and HR teams to ensure that compensation decisions are based on objective criteria and that processes are transparent to mitigate these perceived biases.
3.  The Strategic Role of Benefits (Q1, Q3, Q8 Related) Beyond base salary, employee benefits are significant factors influencing decisions to join and leave an organization. The survey indicates that 68% of respondents agree that their company understands the importance of benefits beyond just salary. This perception is moderately positive, with a mean score of 3.85 out of 5. However, there is significant variability across different segments.
    ◦
    By Country: Perceptions vary widely, with higher scores in regions like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and India, and lower scores in Japan and France.
    ◦
    By Age: Early-career employees (Gen Z) may seek career development alongside benefits, while older employees (Baby Boomers) may prioritize retirement security and health benefits.
    ◦
    By Employment Type: Contract workers may need enhanced benefits communication to feel included in the total rewards narrative. These variations underscore that employees have evolving and distinct needs that require tailored benefits packages. For Rewards Leaders, this means localized benefits strategies are crucial in regions with lower scores. Segment-specific customization is necessary to address the unique needs of different age groups and employment types. We must ensure that our benefits offerings truly meet these evolving needs to effectively attract and retain talent.
4.  Connecting Compensation to Broader Concerns (Themes 3 & Q7) The Theme 3 research brief explicitly focuses on "The New Wage Benchmark – How Companies Are Balancing Pay Pressures with Market Realities," emphasizing the need to explore survey items related to compensation, pay fairness, and cost pressures. The Q7 analysis also strongly supports the cost-of-living/compensation angle as a key concern. While the Q9 and Q17 datasets reviewed in other contexts did not contain compensation data, the focus on pay in Q1 and the perceived equity issues in Q6, combined with the thematic emphasis on rising pay pressures, confirm that compensation remains a highly relevant area of employee concern that Rewards Leaders must address.
5.  Perceptions of Advancement and Performance Link (DEI Bias Data) While the survey doesn't detail specific performance-based reward systems, perceptions of fairness in career advancement are highly relevant to Rewards Leaders, as performance is often linked to promotion and associated pay increases. The data shows significant percentages of employees feel overlooked for career advancement due to various biases, including race (34.3% overall), gender identity, and age. For example, younger (18-24) and older (65+) employees report significant age-related bias in leadership roles and promotions. Female respondents also report higher levels of feeling overlooked (38%) compared to males (25%) due to racial factors. These findings suggest potential issues in how performance is evaluated and rewarded, impacting perceptions of fairness in advancement, which is crucial for performance-based rewards and overall employee motivation.
    Strategic Implications for Rewards Leaders
    Based on these insights, the following strategic implications are critical for Rewards Leaders:
    •
    Prioritize Competitive Pay: Reinforce the commitment to benchmarking and staying ahead of market pay rates, as pay is a primary driver for talent attraction and a key signal of employee value.
    •
    Conduct Robust Pay Equity Analysis: Regularly analyze compensation data across gender, race, age, and other relevant dimensions to identify and address actual disparities, and implement transparent remediation strategies to build trust and address perceived biases.
    •
    Tailor Total Rewards Strategies: Move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches. Customize compensation and benefits packages based on segment-specific needs, particularly considering regional differences, age groups, and employment types.
    •
    Communicate the Full Value of Benefits: Develop clear and compelling communications that articulate how benefits complement salary to create a holistic, competitive total rewards package, especially for segments with lower perceived understanding of benefits.
    •
    Address Perceived Bias in Advancement: Work collaboratively with Leadership Development and DEI teams to ensure that performance management and promotion processes are transparent, standardized, and free from bias. The high percentage of employees feeling overlooked impacts perceptions of fairness, which is critical for linking performance to rewards effectively.
    •
    Balance Cost Pressures with Employee Expectations: Acknowledge and navigate the impact of rising pay pressures and cost-of-living concerns on employee expectations. Data-driven insights can help make informed decisions about resource allocation in compensation budgets.
    •
    Leverage Data for Benchmarking and Accountability: Use internal survey data alongside external benchmarks to continuously track progress on employee perceptions of pay fairness, benefits value, and overall total rewards satisfaction. If certain segments lag behind, deploy targeted interventions.
    Conclusion
    The 2025 Global Workforce Survey provides a critical pulse check on employee perceptions concerning compensation, benefits, and fairness in the workplace. For Rewards Leaders, the data clearly indicates that competitive pay remains paramount for attraction, while perceived equity in pay and advancement is essential for retention and trust. By deeply understanding the nuanced priorities and perceived disparities across different employee segments, Rewards Leaders can design and implement data-driven total rewards strategies that effectively balance market demands with employee expectations, ensuring fairness, driving performance, and ultimately contributing to organizational resilience and future success.
