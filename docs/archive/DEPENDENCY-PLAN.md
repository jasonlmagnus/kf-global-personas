# Dependency Conflict Resolution Plan

## Current Issue

- React 19.1.0 conflicts with cmdk@0.2.1 which requires React 18.x
- Currently using the `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` as a temporary solution

## Current Status (as of YYYY-MM-DD) <!-- Replace YYYY-MM-DD with actual date -->

- The project is still using React 19.1.0 and `cmdk@^0.2.0`.
- The `.npmrc` file still contains `legacy-peer-deps=true`.
- The recommended action (Option 1: Downgrade React to v18.2.0) has NOT been implemented.
- This plan remains relevant.

## Long-term Solutions

### Option 1: Downgrade React (Recommended)

1. **Downgrade React to v18.2.0**
   ```
   npm uninstall react react-dom
   npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0
   ```
   - **Pros**: Most compatible with existing dependencies, lowest risk
   - **Cons**: Lose latest React features

### Option 2: Update or Replace cmdk

1. **Check for newer cmdk versions**

   ```
   npm install cmdk@latest
   ```

   - **Pros**: Keep React 19, most direct solution
   - **Cons**: May still have compatibility issues

2. **Replace cmdk with an alternative command palette solution**
   - Consider: Kbar, HexaCommand, Ninja Keys
   - **Pros**: May find a React 19 compatible solution
   - **Cons**: Requires refactoring command interface components

### Option 3: Fork and Update cmdk

1. **Fork the cmdk repository**
2. **Update it to support React 19**
3. **Use the forked version**
   ```
   npm install github:your-username/cmdk
   ```
   - **Pros**: Keep existing code structure, update to React 19
   - **Cons**: Requires maintaining a fork

## Implementation Timeline

1. For immediate deployment: Keep using legacy-peer-deps
2. For the next sprint: Implement Option 1 (Downgrade React)
3. Long-term: Evaluate Option 2 or 3 as React 19 becomes more widely supported by packages

## Testing Requirements

- Test UI components thoroughly after any dependency changes
- Ensure all command palette functionality works properly
- Verify build process completes without warnings
