## Executive Summary

This plan delivers an 18-piece, persona-specific content programme that positions Korn Ferry's flagship solutions—KF Assess, Talent Hub, Leadership Architect, KF Pay and Total Rewards Consulting—as answers to the most urgent, shared challenges surfaced across six leadership personas. The themes are **AI-Accelerated Transformation**, **Future-Skills & Human-Centred Leadership**, and **Total Rewards & EVP for Sustainable Growth**.

## Strategic Rationale by Theme

### Theme 1 – AI-Accelerated Talent & Business Transformation

**Cross-persona evidence**

- CEOs report a **24-point gap** between AI ambition and workforce readiness.
- CHROs highlight an **85-point "ambition–readiness" gulf** within HR itself.
- TA leaders note **55 % of recruiters** feel under-trained on AI hiring tools.
- Sales leaders see only **25 % of teams** forecasting within ±5 % accuracy due to AI skill gaps.
- L&D leaders cite a **61-point divide** between AI skills needed and programme coverage.
- Rewards leaders face rising mandates for **analytics-driven pay-equity audits** as AI transparency laws tighten.

**Business risk & opportunity**  
Silos in AI governance and capability stall ROI and heighten compliance risk. Firms that deploy **explainable AI, governance frameworks and rapid up-skilling** can convert technology spend into measurable value.

**Korn Ferry leverage points**  
KF Assess (bias-audited algorithms), AI-enabled RPO & Talent Hub, and leader AI-fluency academies form an integrated "strategy-to-execution bridge."

---

### Theme 2 – Future-Skills & Human-Centred Leadership Development

**Cross-persona evidence**

- HR reports only **5 % AI-ready**, while 66 % of line leaders require AI fluency for new hires.
- Gen Z and millennials flag training as their **top retention driver**.
- CHROs reveal **49 % of employees** feel training lags tech change.
- CEOs see a **38-point deficit** in enterprise AI-skills confidence.
- Continuous sales-team coaching correlates with a **40 % attrition drop**.
- TA leaders pivot to **skills-based hiring** to future-proof talent pipelines.

**Business risk & opportunity**  
Digital strategy stalls and attrition rises without accelerated re-skilling. Organisations that embed **human-centred leadership and skills taxonomies** close capability gaps and boost engagement.

**Korn Ferry leverage points**  
Leadership Architect (future-skills blueprint), KF Learn & Coach (AI-personalised learning paths), and Talent Hub (skills taxonomy + mobility) enable a unified, data-driven up-skilling engine.

---

### Theme 3 – Total Rewards & EVP for Sustainable Growth

**Cross-persona evidence**

- Rewards leaders battle a **34-point pay-fairness satisfaction gap** between executives and ICs.
- **37 % of women vs 27 % of men** feel overlooked for raises.
- Pay is the **#1 reason to leave** for 80 % of job-switchers.
- CEOs link a **16-point drop** in perceived fairness directly to retention risk.
- TA leaders stress compensation as **top attraction driver** amid talent shortages.
- 87 % of sales reps rank comp & growth as decisive for staying.

**Business risk & opportunity**  
Opaque or inconsistent rewards erode trust and inflate churn costs. **Data-rich, market-responsive reward designs** reinforce EVP, engagement and margin.

**Korn Ferry leverage points**  
KF Pay analytics (global benchmarks, equity diagnostics) and Total Rewards consulting provide leaders the data and governance to translate fair pay into retention and growth gains.
